### NoQ Bites

”**NoQ Bites**” is a multi-disciplinary web application that allows UW students to save their time while ordering food on campus and it eases the process for ordering food online as they don’t have to stand in long queues. 

This portal helps students to get an idea of all the food outlets across the campus and simultaneously overcomes the disadvantage of traditional queueing and ultimately saving student’s time and making it hassle free.
